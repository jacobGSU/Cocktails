# Cocktails is a simulation of a system that can manage a bar that generally serves spirits and wines.
As drinks are made and registered to the system, the system know how much in ounces to deduct from the stock supply to give alert
of how much stock is remaining. It can give interesting information such as which drinks were the most popular selling
and vice versal which is which were the least selling. In this project, MYSQL is the main engine that drives this project. Much more
built in queries are done so that the user of a cashier can touch one buttton and the system makes all the necessary SQL queries to 
abstract information about the current state of the database.
